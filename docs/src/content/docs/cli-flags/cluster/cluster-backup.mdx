Creates a backup archive containing Kubernetes resource manifests.

The backup is stored as a compressed tarball (.tar.gz) with resources organized by type.
Metadata about the backup is included for restore operations.

Note: This backs up resource manifests (YAML) only. Persistent volume
contents are not included in the current implementation.

Example:
  ksail cluster backup --output ./my-backup.tar.gz
  ksail cluster backup -o ./backup.tar.gz --namespaces default,kube-system
  ksail cluster backup -o ./backup.tar.gz --exclude-types events,pods

Usage:
  ksail cluster backup [flags]

Flags:
      --compression int         Compression level (0-9, default: -1 (gzip default)) (default -1)
      --exclude-types strings   Resource types to exclude from backup (default [events])
      --include-volumes         Include persistent volume data in backup (not yet implemented)
  -n, --namespaces strings      Namespaces to backup (default: all)
  -o, --output string           Output path for backup archive (required)

Global Flags:
      --benchmark   Show per-activity benchmark output
