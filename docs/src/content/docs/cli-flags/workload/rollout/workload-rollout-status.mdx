Show the status of the rollout.

 By default 'rollout status' will watch the status of the latest rollout until it's done. If you don't want to wait for the rollout to finish then you can use --watch=false. Note that if a new rollout starts in-between, then 'rollout status' will continue watching the latest revision. If you want to pin to a specific revision and abort if it is rolled over by another revision, use --revision=N where N is the revision you need to watch for.

Usage:
  ksail workload rollout status (TYPE NAME | TYPE/NAME) [flags]

Examples:
  # Watch the rollout status of a deployment
  kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx

Flags:
  -f, --filename strings   Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to get from a server.
  -h, --help               help for status
  -k, --kustomize string   Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -R, --recursive          Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
      --revision int       Pin to a specific revision for showing its status. Defaults to 0 (last revision).
  -l, --selector string    Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', '!=', 'in', 'notin'.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2,key3 in (value3)). Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.
      --timeout duration   The length of time to wait before ending watch, zero means never. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).
  -w, --watch              Watch the status of the rollout until it's done. (default true)

Global Flags:
      --timing   Show per-activity timing output
```
