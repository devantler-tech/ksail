# ksail workload exec

```text
Execute a command in a container in a pod.

Usage:
  ksail workload exec

Examples:
  # Get output from running the 'date' command from pod mypod, using the first container by default
  ksail workload exec mypod -- date
  
  # Get output from running the 'date' command in ruby-container from pod mypod
  ksail workload exec mypod -c ruby-container -- date
  
  # Switch to raw terminal mode; sends stdin to 'bash' in ruby-container from pod mypod
  # and sends stdout/stderr from 'bash' back to the client
  ksail workload exec mypod -c ruby-container -i -t -- bash -il
  
  # List contents of /usr from the first container of pod mypod and sort by modification time
  # If the command you want to execute in the pod has any flags in common (e.g. -i),
  # you must use two dashes (--) to separate your command's flags/arguments
  # Also note, do not surround your command and its flags/arguments with quotes
  # unless that is how you would execute it normally (i.e., do ls -t /usr, not "ls -t /usr")
  ksail workload exec mypod -i -t -- ls -t /usr
  
  # Get output from running 'date' command from the first pod of the deployment mydeployment, using the first container by default
  ksail workload exec deploy/mydeployment -- date
  
  # Get output from running 'date' command from the first pod of the service myservice, using the first container by default
  ksail workload exec svc/myservice -- date
