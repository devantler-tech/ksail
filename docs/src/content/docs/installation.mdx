## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

KSail works on all major operating systems and modern CPU architectures:

| OS                   | Architecture    |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 🐧 Linux             | amd64 and arm64 |
|  macOS              | arm64           |
| ⊞ Windows (untested) | amd64 and arm64 |

### Docker (Required for Local Clusters)

**Docker is required** to create local clusters using the Docker provider. Install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine and ensure `docker ps` works.

- [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

After installation, verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Provider Support

The supported Kubernetes distributions (x-axis) run on different infrastructure providers (y-axis). You need to have access to at least one provider for your chosen distribution.

| Provider | Vanilla   | K3s      | Talos |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----- |
| Docker   | ✅ (Kind) | ✅ (K3d) | ✅    |
| Hetzner  | —         | —        | ✅    |

> [!NOTE]
> Talos on Hetzner requires a Hetzner Cloud account and API token (`HCLOUD_TOKEN`). See the [Support Matrix](/support-matrix/) for more details.

## Installation Methods

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Homebrew">
    ### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

    The easiest way to install KSail on macOS or Linux:

    ```bash
    brew install --cask devantler-tech/tap/ksail
    ```

    This installs the latest stable release and makes `ksail` available in your PATH.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Go Install">
    ### Go Install

    If you have Go 1.25.4+ installed, you can install KSail directly from source:

    ```bash
    go install github.com/devantler-tech/ksail/v5@latest
    ```

    This builds and installs the `ksail` binary to `$GOPATH/bin` (typically `~/go/bin`). Ensure this directory is in your PATH.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Binary Download">
    ### Binary Download

    Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/devantler-tech/ksail/releases) page:

    1. Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/devantler-tech/ksail/releases/latest)
    2. Download the appropriate binary for your OS and architecture
    3. Extract the archive
    4. Move the `ksail` binary to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`)
    5. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x ksail`

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="From Source">
    ### Build from Source

    Clone the repository and build the binary:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devantler-tech/ksail.git
    cd ksail
    go build -o ksail
    ```

    The `ksail` binary will be created in the current directory. Move it to a directory in your PATH if desired.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Embedded Tools

KSail embeds common Kubernetes tools as Go libraries, so **you don't need to install them separately**:

- **kubectl** — Kubernetes command-line tool
- **helm** — Kubernetes package manager
- **kind** — Kubernetes in Docker (for Vanilla distribution)
- **k3d** — K3s in Docker (for K3s distribution)
- **flux** — GitOps toolkit (optional)
- **argocd** — Declarative GitOps (optional)
- **sops** — Secret encryption (optional)

All these tools are available through KSail's unified CLI interface.

## Optional: GitHub Copilot CLI (for AI Chat)

To use the `ksail chat` AI assistant feature, you need the GitHub Copilot CLI:

1. **Install Copilot CLI**: Follow the [Copilot CLI installation guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line/about-github-copilot-in-the-cli#installing-copilot-in-the-cli)
2. **Authenticate**: Run `copilot auth login` to authenticate with your GitHub account
3. **Set path (if needed)**: Set `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable if the CLI is not in your PATH

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Copilot requires an active subscription. The `ksail chat` command is optional and all other KSail features work without it.
