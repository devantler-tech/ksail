# Distribution

This document describes how KSail is distributed and how to submit it to package managers.

## Homebrew Distribution

KSail is distributed via Homebrew for macOS and Linux users.

### Current Distribution

KSail is currently available through a custom Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install devantler-tech/formulas/ksail
```

This formula is automatically published by GoReleaser when a new release is created.

4. **Maintain the Formula**
