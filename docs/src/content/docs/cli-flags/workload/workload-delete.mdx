Delete Kubernetes resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

Usage:
  ksail workload delete

Examples:
  # Delete a pod using the type and name specified in pod.json
  ksail workload delete -f ./pod.json
  
  # Delete resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml - e.g. dir/kustomization.yaml
  ksail workload delete -k dir
  
  # Delete resources from all files that end with '.json'
  ksail workload delete -f '*.json'
  
  # Delete a pod based on the type and name in the JSON passed into stdin
  cat pod.json | ksail workload delete -f -
  
  # Delete pods and services with same names "baz" and "foo"
  ksail workload delete pod,service baz foo
  
  # Delete pods and services with label name=myLabel
  ksail workload delete pods,services -l name=myLabel
  
  # Delete a pod with minimal delay
  ksail workload delete pod foo --now
  
  # Force delete a pod on a dead node
  ksail workload delete pod foo --force
  
  # Delete all pods
  ksail workload delete pods --all
  
  # Delete all pods only if the user confirms the deletion
  ksail workload delete pods --all --interactive

Flags:
      --all                             Delete all resources, in the namespace of the specified resource types.
  -A, --all-namespaces                  If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --as string                       Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
      --as-group stringArray            Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --as-uid string                   UID to impersonate for the operation.
      --as-user-extra stringArray       User extras to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple values for the same key.
      --cache-dir string                Default cache directory (default "~/.kube/cache")
      --cascade string[="background"]   Must be "background", "orphan", or "foreground". Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController). Defaults to background. (default "background")
      --certificate-authority string    Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --client-certificate string       Path to a client certificate file for TLS
      --client-key string               Path to a client key file for TLS
      --cluster string                  The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
      --context string                  The name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --disable-compression             If true, opt-out of response compression for all requests to the server
      --dry-run string[="unchanged"]    Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource. (default "none")
      --field-selector string           Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
  -f, --filename strings                containing the resource to delete.
      --force                           If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
      --grace-period int                Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion). (default -1)
      --ignore-not-found                Treat "resource not found" as a successful delete. Defaults to "true" when --all is specified.
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify        If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
  -i, --interactive                     If true, delete resource only when user confirms.
      --kubeconfig string               Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests. (default "~/.kube/config")
  -k, --kustomize string                Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -n, --namespace string                If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
      --now                             If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown (same as --grace-period=1).
  -o, --output string                   Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
      --raw string                      Raw URI to DELETE to the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
  -R, --recursive                       Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
      --request-timeout string          The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests. (default "0")
  -l, --selector string                 Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', '!=', 'in', 'notin'.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2,key3 in (value3)). Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.
  -s, --server string                   The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
      --timeout duration                The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
      --tls-server-name string          Server name to use for server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --token string                    Bearer token for authentication to the API server
      --user string                     The name of the kubeconfig user to use
      --wait                            If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers. (default true)

Global Flags:
      --benchmark   Show per-activity benchmark output
