Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service.

Usage:
  ksail workload expose

Examples:
  # Create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  ksail workload expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # Create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in "nginx-controller.yaml", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  ksail workload expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # Create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name "frontend"
  ksail workload expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend
  
  # Create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name "nginx-https"
  ksail workload expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https
  
  # Create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing UDP traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  ksail workload expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=UDP --name=video-stream
  
  # Create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  ksail workload expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # Create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  ksail workload expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

Flags:
      --allow-missing-template-keys    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats. (default true)
      --cluster-ip string              ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to auto-allocate, or set to 'None' to create a headless service.
      --dry-run string[="unchanged"]   Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource. (default "none")
      --external-ip string             Additional external IP address (not managed by Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in addition to its generated service IP.
      --field-manager string           Name of the manager used to track field ownership. (default "kubectl-expose")
  -f, --filename strings               Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to expose a service
  -k, --kustomize string               Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -l, --labels string                  Labels to apply to the service created by this call.
      --load-balancer-ip string        IP to assign to the LoadBalancer. If empty, an ephemeral IP will be created and used (cloud-provider specific).
      --name string                    The name for the newly created object.
  -o, --output string                  Output format. One of: (json, yaml, kyaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).
      --override-type string           The method used to override the generated object: json, merge, or strategic. (default "merge")
      --overrides string               An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.
      --port string                    The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified
      --protocol string                The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'TCP'.
  -R, --recursive                      Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
      --save-config                    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
      --selector string                A label selector to use for this service. Only equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the resource being exposed.
      --session-affinity string        If non-empty, set the session affinity for the service to this; legal values: 'None', 'ClientIP'
      --show-managed-fields            If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
      --target-port string             Name or number for the port on the container that the service should direct traffic to. Optional.
      --template string                Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
      --type string                    Type for this service: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalName. Default is 'ClusterIP'.

Global Flags:
      --benchmark   Show per-activity benchmark output
