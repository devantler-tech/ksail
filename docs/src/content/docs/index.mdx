## Why KSail?

Setting up and operating Kubernetes clusters often requires juggling multiple CLI tools, writing bespoke scripts, and dealing with inconsistent workflows. KSail removes the tooling overhead so you can focus on your workloads.

## Key Features

- 📦 **One Binary** — Embeds cluster provisioning, GitOps engines, and deployment tooling. No tool sprawl.
- ☸️ **Simple Clusters** — Spin up Vanilla, K3s, or Talos clusters with one command. Same workflow across distributions.
- 🌐 **LoadBalancer Support** — Built-in LoadBalancer services via cloud-provider integrations (e.g., cloud-provider-kind for Vanilla, ServiceLB for K3s). MetalLB integration for Talos×Docker is planned.
- 📥 **Mirror Registries** — Avoid rate limits, and store images once. Same mirrors used by different clusters.
- 📄 **Everything as Code** — Cluster settings, distribution configs, and workloads in version-controlled files.
- 🔄 **GitOps Native** — Built-in Flux or ArgoCD support with bootstrap, push, and reconcile commands.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Stack** — Select your CNI, CSI, policy engine, cert-manager, and mirror registries.
- 🔐 **SOPS Built In** — Encrypt, decrypt, and edit secrets with integrated cipher commands.
- 🤖 **AI Assistant** — Interactive chat powered by GitHub Copilot for configuration and troubleshooting.
- 💻 **VSCode Extension** — Manage clusters from VSCode with wizards, sidebar views, and command palette.

## Prerequisites

KSail works on all major operating systems and CPU architectures:

| OS | Architecture |
|----|--------------|
| 🐧 Linux | amd64, arm64 |
| macOS | arm64 |
| ⊞ Windows (untested) | amd64, arm64 |

**Docker is required** for local clusters. Install Docker Desktop/Engine and ensure `docker ps` works.

Supported distributions run on different infrastructure providers:

| Provider | Vanilla | K3s | Talos |
|----------|---------|-----|-------|
| Docker | ✅ (Kind) | ✅ (K3d) | ✅ |
| Hetzner | — | — | ✅ |

## Quick Start

``````bash
# 1. Initialize a new project
ksail cluster init --name my-cluster --distribution Vanilla

# 2. Create and start the cluster
ksail cluster create

# 3. Add manifests to k8s/ directory

# 4. Deploy workloads
ksail workload apply -k ./k8s

# 5. Update cluster configuration (modify ksail.yaml, then run)
ksail cluster update            # Apply configuration changes

# 6. Connect with K9s
ksail cluster connect
``````
