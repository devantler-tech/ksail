# Configuration

Everything that KSail does and can do is configurable in a declarative manner. This allows you to manage everything from the configuration of KSail itself, the configuration of the Kubernetes distribution you are using, or even the configuration of SOPS for managing secrets in Git repositories.

## KSail Configuration

KSail provides a fully declarative configuration for managing everything it does. This configuration is stored in a `ksail-config.yaml` file in the root of your project.

KSail uses the following priority when loading in the configuration:

1. The default configuration
2. The configuration in the `ksail-config.yaml` file in the root of your project
3. Command-line flags

So, you can always override the configuration in the `ksail-config.yaml` file with command-line flags, if you need to.

```yaml

## Distribution Configuration

### Kind

To configure Kind, you use a `kind-config.yaml` file in the root of your project. To learn more about the configuration options for Kind, you can check out the [official Kind documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/).

### K3d

To configure K3d, you use a `k3d-config.yaml` file in the root of your project. To learn more about the configuration options for K3d, you can check out the [official K3d documentation](https://k3d.io/v5.7.4/usage/configfile/#all-options-example).

## SOPS Configuration

To configure SOPS, you use a `.sops.yaml` file in the root of your project. To learn more about the configuration options for SOPS, you can check out the [official SOPS documentation](https://getsops.io/docs/#using-sopsyaml-conf-to-select-kms-pgp-and-age-for-new-files).
