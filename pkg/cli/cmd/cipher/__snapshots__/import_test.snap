[TestImportCommandHelp - 1]
Import an age private key to the system's default SOPS age key location.

The private key must be provided as a command argument and must include the full
key with the AGE-SECRET-KEY- prefix.

The public key will be automatically derived from the private key.

The command will automatically add metadata including:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Public key (derived from private key)

Key file location (checked in order):
  1. SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE environment variable
  2. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age/keys.txt (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
  3. Platform-specific defaults:
     Linux:   $HOME/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
     macOS:   $HOME/Library/Application Support/sops/age/keys.txt
     Windows: %AppData%\sops\age\keys.txt

The private key must be in age format (starting with "AGE-SECRET-KEY-").

Examples:
  # Import a private key (public key will be derived automatically)
  ksail cipher import AGE-SECRET-KEY-1ABCDEF...

Usage:
  cipher import PRIVATE_KEY [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for import
